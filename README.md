<!-- Introduction -->
## 🐝 Introduction

Detecting and preventing absconding events in beehives is a critical challenge for beekeepers. Our Smart Beehive Monitoring System aims to address this issue by leveraging advanced technologies to provide early and reliable detection of abscondment.

Manually detecting when bees abandon a beehive is challenging and often leads to delayed responses. Understanding the factors contributing to their departure is crucial for effective beekeeping practices.

<!-- Solution -->
## 🐝 Solution

Our solution involves the deployment of camera sensors at the beehive entrance. These sensors capture data that is processed by an artificial intelligence (AI) model. The AI model distinguishes between bees carrying pollen and those that do not, offering a more accurate and timely indication of potential absconding events.


## 🐝 Features
<!-- Features -->


Our Smart Beehive Monitoring System offers the following features:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: The system provides real-time feedback and alerts to the beekeepers via a web or mobile application. This is made possible by our suite of sensors that continuously monitor the hive environment and stream live data to the cloud.

- **Historical Analysis**: The system stores the sensor data in a secure database. The beekeepers can access this historical data to visualize the trends and patterns of the hive environment over time.

- **Sensor Suite**: Our system utilizes a suite of sensors to gather critical data about the hive environment. This includes a humidity sensor, a temperature sensor, a CO2 gas sensor, and a weight sensor. These sensors provide valuable insights into the health and productivity of the bee colony.

- **User-friendly Interface**: The system has a simple and intuitive user interface that allows the beekeepers to easily monitor and manage their beehives. The system also supports multiple languages and has a voice assistant feature for convenience.


## 🐝 Sensor Suite

Our Smart Beehive Monitoring System utilizes a suite of sensors to gather critical data about the hive environment:

- **Humidity Sensor**: This sensor measures the relative humidity inside the beehive. Maintaining the right humidity level is crucial for the health of the bee colony and the quality of the honey.

- **Temperature Sensor**: This sensor monitors the temperature inside the beehive. Bees need to keep the hive at a constant temperature to ensure the survival of the brood.

- **CO2 Gas Sensor**: This sensor measures the level of carbon dioxide inside the beehive. High levels of CO2 can be a sign of poor ventilation or overcrowding.

- **Weight Sensor**: This sensor measures the weight of the beehive. Changes in weight can indicate honey production, bee population changes, or possible issues like theft or disease.

These sensors provide real-time data that is essential for monitoring the health and productivity of the bee colony. In the next phase of our project, we plan to feed this data into an AI model for more advanced analysis and prediction.
